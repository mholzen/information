# INFORMATION

A Go library and web server to:
- parse text files of various types into a graph database
- query, transform, compute on those graphs
- visualize, edit and output to various file types


## Motivation

Use representation of knowlege as a graph to facilitate both
highly abstract conceptual thinking and mundane data management.

The recent development in LLMs has confirmed my intuiton that
a tremenudous amount of knowledge (if not all) is encoded in language.

Nonetheless, I continue to be interested in a more traditional approach
to store and process language (i.e. using formal constructs rather than 
using neural networks), because I cam curious to explore whether we can
encode some fundamental truths about our experience, much like one would
using a programming language.
