# INFORMATION

A Go library and web server to:
- parse text files of various types into a graph database
- query, transform, compute on those graphs
- visualize, edit and output to various file types


## Motivation

Use representation of knowlege as a graph to facilitate both
highly abstract conceptual thinking and mundane data management.

The recent development in LLMA has confirmed my intuiton that
a tremenudous amount of knowledge (if not all) is encoding in language.

While taking a more traditional approach in storing and processing language,
I am interesting in whether we can express some fundamental truths about
our experience.
